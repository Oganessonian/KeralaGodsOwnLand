Kerala God's Own Land:
This is a Capstone project for WdFE course taught by honourable Dr Collen Van Lent, University of Michigan. 
Since this is only a demonstration of the front-end web designing, backend things such as database creation and user interaction are absent, except some javaScript based user interaction responses. 
Three pages, Page 1(index.html) includes history and geography, Page2 (festivals.html) includes festivals from diverse religions, and Page3 (wildelife.html) includes wildlie and biodiversity. 
Skip to main feature added (with tab index =0) for accessiblity, but also includes a 'hover area' where if the user hovers the cursor, then the skip to mains appears. 
Carousal, by default is stationar, but runs on the first user interaction. Stops if the user hovers over the image, Runs again if the cursor is away. There is custome close and refresh buttons added for extra accessibilty and UX. Carousal has caption heading and caption paragraph with a translucent glass effect to address the contrast error (accessiblity). In very small mobiles, only the heading will be visible so that the caption description doesn't hinder the view. 
Header structure is different in mobile/tablet and PC views.
In mobile clicking on the hamburger menu slides the menu (nav links) from the top. In tablet view, clicking on the hamburger menu slides the menu (nav links) from the left side. 
In PC view the nav link are horizontally displayed in the header area where an image is also present on left that has animation. 
In PC view the action icons slide from the right when the user scrolls and is on the mains area. 
The "homeicon" on the mobile and tablet view, if clicked will show a popup message to direct the user to use hamburger menu (navlinks).
The images in the sections are present in "card" and if the user clicks on the images then they will open up as lightbox2 gallery on each page. 
Parallax has been added, so when the user scolls, and in in a particular section, then its image will be displayed and spinning. 
An offcanvas "section navigator" is present which will open if the user clicks on a custome-made icon present in the bottom left corner of the page (black icon with white border and transparent arrow).
The section navigator popsup from the bottom. And it also has x button to close. Else if the user clicks on the backdrop then also it closes. However, the user can either scroll even if the backgrop is present or by clcking on the section name in the offcanvas. 
A login link is also in the nav links, and if the user clicks on it, then the login/password window will be displayed, If the user fills up the name and email address and clicks on sumit then the navlink menu will show the users name and an option to logout. The user can logout by clcking on this. 
In the comment seciton, is the user types something and clicks on submit then the thanks message will be shown, if the user clicks on cancer/clear button then the comment is cleared. 
All html and CSS files have been validated by W3C validator. 
WAVE didn't show any error, contrast error or alerts.
